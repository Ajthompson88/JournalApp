## My Coding Journal App
  My Coding Journal--Your perfect partner throughout your coding journey
  Keep track of all your thoughts and ideas, yes even confusing thoughts as you progress through the coding bootcamp. 
  Studies show that journaling help us process our ideas better and gives us a way to express out feelings (both positive and negative). 
  So whether you had a great class and made a lot of progress, or are a little (or a 	 lot lost), let My Coding Journal help you navigate through the class. 
  There is a place to copy and paste code and a place to write what you learned, what you wished you learned and what is still confusing to you. Go back and revisit previous entries whenever you like.
  Keep all your notes and thoughts in one place and access them anytime from your device. I hope My Coding Journal helps make your coding journey a little easier!
